Question: What is the difference between public and private modifiers?

Answer: When we declare a private method, it is only accessible within a Class. But when we declare a public method, it is not only accessible within the Class but also throughout the projects.

Currently, we cannot discuss the differences between public and private modifiers in deep detail. We'll discuss them in the next module.
